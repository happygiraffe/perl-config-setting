=head1 NAME

Config::Setting::FileProvider - return the contents of files.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Config::Setting::FileProvider;
  my $p = Config::Setting::FileProvider->new(Env => "MYRCFILES",
                                             Paths => ["/etc/myrc",
                                                       "~/.myrc"]);
  my @contents = $p->provide();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class presents an interface to file contents.  It returns the
contents of various files, in order to the application that requests it.

It is not intended that this class be used standalone, rather that it
be used as part of the L<Config::Setting> module.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new ( ARGS )

Create a new object.  ARGS is a set of keyword / value pairs.
Recognised options are:

=over 4

=item Env

The name of an environment variable to look at.  If it exists, it will
contain a colon separated list of paths to settings files.

=item Paths

A list of file paths to be used, in order, for settings files.

=back

In both Env and Paths, you may use the tilde-notation ("~") to specify
home directories.

Any files specified in Paths will also have an identical file searched
for but with the hostname specified.  This should make per-host
customization simpler.

Any Env settings files will be looked at I<after> any Paths settings
files.

It is reccomended that you specify both parameters in the constructor.

=item provide ( )

Return a list of file contents, one per file read.
