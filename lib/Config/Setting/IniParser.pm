=head1 NAME

Config::Setting::IniParser - parse windows .ini style files.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Config::Setting::IniParser;

 my $ini = Config::Setting::IniParser->new(Filename => $inifile);
 foreach my $s ($ini->sections()) {
     print "[$s]\n";
     foreach my $k ($ini->keylist($s)) {
         print $k, "=", $ini->get($s, $k), "\n";
     }
     print "\n";
 }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides OO access to windows .ini style files.  At present,
it only provides read access, not writing.

=head1 METHODS

=item new ( ARGS )

Instantiate a new object.  ARGS is a set of keyword / value pairs.
Recognised options are:

=over 4

=item CommentChar

Pass in a character that is used as a comment inside the data.  This
defaults to "#", but is also commonly ";".

=back

=item parse_file ( FILENAME )

Parse FILENAME into the object.

=item parse_string ( STRING )

Parse STRING into the object.

=item sections ( )

Return a list of all sections that occurred in the data.  They are
returned in the order in which they originally occurred.

=item keylist ( SECTION )

Return a list of all keys in SECTION.

=item get ( SECTION, KEY )

Does not cater for quoted keys and values.

It is a bit eager about comment stripping.
