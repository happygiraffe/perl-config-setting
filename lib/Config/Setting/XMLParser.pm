=head1 NAME

Config::Setting::XMLParser - parse XML settings file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Config::Setting::XMLParser;

 my $ini = Config::Setting::XMLParser->new(Filename => $xmlfile);
 foreach my $s ($ini->sections()) {
     print "[$s]\n";
     foreach my $k ($ini->keylist($s)) {
         print $k, "=", $ini->get($s, $k), "\n";
     }
     print "\n";
 }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides access to settings stored in an XML File.  The XML
File is expected to have the following structure:

  <settings>
    <section name="SECTION">
      <item name="KEY">VALUE</item>
    </section>
  </settings>

Multiple E<lt>sectionE<gt>s and E<lt>itemE<gt>s may be present.  Any
leading and trailing whitespace within an E<lt>itemE<gt> tag will be
stripped.
