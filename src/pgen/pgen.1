.SH NAME
pgen \- procmailrc generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
pgen [\-m] [\-o outfile] procmail.m4
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pgen
runs over
.I procmail.m4
using the
.BR m4 (1)
macro processor and some predefined macros.  These
macros make it easier to maintain a procmailrc file.  The output
can be used as your
.I ~/.procmailrc
file.  The contents of procmail.m4 should be the same as described
in
.BR procmailrc (5),
with the exception of the macros described below.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fI\-m\fR
Specify that you will be using MH mailboxes, rather than standard
mbox format files.
.IP \fI\-o\fR
Specify the destination file, instead of standard output.
.SH MACROS
The following macros will be expanded in the input.  Several of
them take a
.I type
argument.  It can be one of JUNK (discard the mail), RCVSTORE (save
it into an MH folder), MH (save it into an MH folder, without
updating the unseen sequence) or MBOX (save it into a standard mbox
file).  In all cases, a folder must also be specified, for locking
purposes.
.IP "STOPDUPS()"
Include a procmail recipe for eradicating duplicate messages that arrive
(based on their message-id).  This uses
.BR formail (1),
so it must be in your PATH.
.IP "LIST(listname, folder [, type])"
Specify that mail that arrives for
.I listname
will be sent to
.IR folder .
.I Listname
is a regular expression that is matched against one of the following
headers in the incoming mail: To, Cc, and Return-Path.
.IP "SUBJ(subject, folder [, type])"
Specify that mail that arrives with a subject of
.I subject
will be sent to
.IR folder .
.I Subject
is a regular expression that is matched against the Subject: header
in the incoming mail.
.IP "FROM(whom, folder [, type])"
Specify that mail that arrives from
.I whom
will be sent to
.IR folder .
.I Whom
is a regular expression that is matched against the From: and
Sender: headers in the incoming mail.
.IP "ARG(word, folder [, type])"
Specify that mail that comes in for you with an argument of
.I word
goes into
.IR folder .
Normally, the argument is the piece of your email address that comes
after your username.  For instance, given the address
dom+pgen@happygiraffe.net, the argument would be
.IR pgen .
.IP "START(listname)"
Specifies the beginning of a block of macros, that will be used only
when
.I listname
matches the To:, Cc: and Return-Path: headers.
.IP "END()"
Ends the block begun by the START macro.
