pgen --- a procmail generating tool.

pgen is a simple set of macros and a command to apply them.  They can
make generating a procmailrc file much simpler for basic cases.

To install:

	% ./configure
	% make
	% make install

See the pgen(1) page for full details.

The basic macros have been in use for over 4 years, I've only just
gotten around to releasing them.  :-(
