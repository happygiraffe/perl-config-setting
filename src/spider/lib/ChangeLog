        * mod.c: Ensured that a sleep occurs between writing multiple
        replies.  This ensures that Spider can use select(2) on a
        per-message basis.

        * mod.c: Also add provision for error-handling through a
        callback.  At present, the only error which is handled (by the
        callback) is ERR_BADUSR.

        * Changed the return type of cmd functions to return a type Reply,
        which can contain more than one reply.  Added a new function to
        help, "new_reply", and a macro, "CUR_REP".

        * mod.c: Made modules *much* more resilient against bad input.
