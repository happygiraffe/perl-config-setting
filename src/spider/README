			    Spider v1.0.2
			    (BETA VERSION)

1.	Compiling

	Pretty much what you'd expect:

	% ./configure
	% make

	Configure is generated by autoconf, so it understands --prefix
	to place the installed files on the correct place on your
	filesystem.  It also understands the environment variables CC,
	CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS, so you can adjust them if
	needed.  Like this:

	% env CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe" ./configure --prefix=/opt/spider

	Also note that the source code can be built for several
	architectures simultaneously, by specifying a path to
	configure.  For example, here's what I use for testing.

	% tar xvzf spider-1.0.2.tar.gz
	% cd spider-1.0.2
	% mkdir build-freebsd
	% cd build-freebsd
	% ../configure --prefix=`pwd`/i
	% make
	% make install

2.	Installing

	Just do make install to install spider to the prefix you
	specified (defaults to /usr/local).  Spider uses the following
	directory layout:

	.../bin			binaries client.
	.../etc/spider		configuration files.
	.../include/ds.h	header for libds.a.
	.../include/mod.h	header for libmod.a.
	.../include/nev.h	header for libnev.a.
	.../lib/libds.a		library for data structures.
	.../lib/libmod.a	library for modules.
	.../lib/libnev.a	library for network events.
	.../lib/spider/		spool directory for spider.
	.../libexec/spider	binary modules.
	.../man			manual pages.
	.../sbin		server binaries.

3.	Running

	Run the spider command to start the daemon.  It has several
	flags, documented in the man page.

	The kill_spider command will stop the daemon.

	The debug_client is a simple wrapper around telnet that
	connects you to the server.  It expects you know the protocol.
	It is reccomended that you get a better client, such as
	tkspider.
