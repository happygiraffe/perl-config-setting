                             Spider v1.0
			    (BETA VERSION)

1) Compiling

   Edit Makefile for your configuration; all configurable items are
   marked so in there.

   CONF_FILE

     Where you would like Spider to retrieve it's configuration from.
     Install it there, before you make Spider and then edit it as
     required.

   SPIDER_FACIL

     This specifies what class of syslog output should be generated.
     See man 3 openlog for full details.  Then, you may find it
     necessary to edit /etc/syslog.conf to set up the log files for
     Spider somewhere convenient.

   DEFINES

     DEBUG: Creates a user called "debug" on the terminal that it is
     run from.  You can enter commands from here.  For modules, then
     if this is defined, they can be run from a terminal.

     DAEMON: If defined, Spider will automatically background itself.

     LOG_CMDS: Spider will log every command sent through it.

   NB: At the moment, you must also configure the messaging module
   manually.  You must edit the file ./modules/alex/msg/config.h to
   have the messaging work correctly.

   Just type in "make".  After this, you should have bin/*,
   lib/libmod.a and modules/{motd,test,page}.

   NB: You *must* do make from the spider directory, not any
   subdirectories.  This is because a lot of make variables (eg:
   CFLAGS) are inherited from there.

2) Installing

   Recommended file layout:

   /home/spider/bin     - Binaries & shell scripts
                etc     - Configuration files
                lib     - Home for libmod.a
                log     - Syslog output (if you want it)
                modules - Source & binaries for the modules
                spool   - Directories for the modules to run in
                src     - Source for Spider (& include files)

   Copy the file etc/spider.conf into the place you specified above
   (if different), and change it so that it's correct for your system.
   Instructions are contained within the file.

   Note that you can include more than one Module_Dir in the config
   file.  So, if you are developing you own modules, you can just
   point it at the development directory.

3) Running

   Just type in bin/spider (or bin/spider &, if you didn't compile
   with DAEMON defined).  Then, you can run bin/debug_client to
   connect to the port that was defined in the spider.conf file.
   However, it is better to run a real client, but we don't have any
   yet.
