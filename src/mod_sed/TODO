* [MOSTLY DONE] Get rid of all statically defined data.

  At present, all the statically defined data is being reused after
  the initial request.  We need to arrange for previously static data
  to be made visible to the handler and to have it initialized to zero
  at the beginning of each request.

  I've already done [HPS]S, but now there's something in mf_fgets()
  which needs looking at, probably related to add_file().

  A handler that only works once is not terribly useful.

  Update: I've now got it working correctly over a number of files,
  the remaining static data does not appear to be important.

* [TODO] Implement timestamps correctly.

  I need to make sure that the last modified time is either that of
  the file being requested or the script, whichever is newer.

* [DONE] Implement HEAD.

  Right now, we're throwing everything back to the client, no matter
  what they ask for.

* [DONE] Redefine err() and errx() to be useful within apache.

  They should abort the current transaction, not exit.  They do this
  with setjmp()/longjmp() around compile().  If there's been an error,
  we log it and return internal server error.

* Portability.

  Convert to ap_ functions everywhere.

  Get rid of err(), errx(), warnx() (see above).

  fgetln() and snprintf() need to have replacements from BSD libc
  installed.  Actually, apache might well have snprintf() itself...

  Hmmm, Linux does have fgetln(), but not RE_STARTEND.  Foo.

* [DONE] Need to move the handler into mod_sed.c...

* [DONE] A normal Makefile would be nice.

* [DONE] More options: SedNoDefaultOutput (-n) and SedExtendedRegex (-E)

* Should handle multiple SedExprs and SedScripts?

* [DONE] Need a pathinfo mapping for alternate script files.

  Something like:

	SedMap	/upper	/tmp/upper.sed

  Which will supercede the usual sed expression when the pathinfo is set
  to "/upper".

* Write a proper man page.

* Find out how to compile statically into apache.

* Cache compiled code...

* Make work as an apache 2.0 filter.
