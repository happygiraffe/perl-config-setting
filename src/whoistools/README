Whois Tools For Python & Zope
-----------------------------

These set of tools allow one to query whois servers for information
easily from with python and Zope.  To get started, you'll need to
download a list of whois servers from the internet.  To do so, run
this command:

% python listmgr.py

That will create the whoislist.py file that the main library needs.

To use the library from within python:

>>> import whois
>>> print whois.Whois("python.org")
...
Yadda, yadda.
...
>>> print whois.Server("python.org")
whois.crsnic.net

It's pretty easy.  There's also a whois.Whoislist function for
returning the output as a list of strings instead.  Read the source
for the full details.

To use this from within Zope, install a link to this directory from
within your ~zope/lib/python/Products directory and restart Zope.  You
will then find a <dtml-whois> tag available.  You can say either:

    <dtml-whois mylookupstring>

Which will attempt to look up the contents of mylookupstring on the
default server, or you can say:

    <dtml-whois mylookupstring server="whois.ripe.net">

which will attempt to use the whois.ripe.net server instead.

Beware that adding whois lookups like this to your pages can
significantly slow down the rendering of your page.  If possible, set
up a local whois mirror (this is possible in the case of the RIPE
database).

There a couple of files in here, which are not part of the package,
just experiments I have been working upon.  There is asyncwhois.py,
from a posting by the eff-bot and ripe.py for working with the
RIPE.net database.

TODO:

* Add a "resolve" option to the Whois function, so that it can cope
  with the multiple whois servers that we now have for .com/.net/.org.
* Complete the ripe.py tools for working with the RIPE database.
* Make asynchwhois.py integrate with the other tools a bit better and
  more functional as a standalone whois query tool.

Any bugs, comments, etc. to Dominic Mitchell <dom@happygiraffe.net>,
please.
